            <h1>Overview</h1>
            
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Aside from the lab work, science communication plays an essential role as experimentation in the application. With proper interaction and brain-storming activities, we, as responsible and reliable scientists, can genuinely share the same level of standpoints with our target audience and explore mutual communication. Therefore, we attempt to share information about synthetic biology and our project with relative communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Our education and science communication projects mainly focus on two goals: <b>a.</b> introducing synthetic biology to the public and <b>b.</b> raise the awareness of CVD prevention. These two are tethered together because lacking any of it might end up failing to tell the whole story of our project: utilizing the synthetic biological way to create pure EPA supplements for artery care. We have observed that most contact people have a vague and one-sided understanding of these two fields. As a result, they have difficulty connecting them in a comprehensive way. We solve the problem by constructing a coherent story from the current issue to our resolution.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;The story is as follows: To prevent CVD, we want to use EPA, which has been proven to have a good effect on reducing cardiac events. Our approaches to CVD prevention include producing pure EPA by synthetic biology and promoting a healthy lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To make our idea more accessible, we designed a web game to promote CVD prevention virtually and remotely. Combining the idea of synthetic biology and CVD prevention, we created a storyline in which the main character, PACO, is dispatched on an adventure wrapped in the theme of experimentation to save her kingdom from illness.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;With those attempts, we sincerely hope that we can make efforts to bridge the gap between society and the academic field. And we are embracing multilateral collaboration.
            </p>

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To prevent the CVD crisis, we devised a new way to synthesize pure EPA without contamination. However, the idea of synthetic biology may be too abstract for normal people to grab. Accordingly, to educate people how we synthesize pure EPA and the beauty of synthetic biology, we held the <b>Open Lab science camp</b> and invited high school students to get involved in synthetic biological experiments.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To let participants precisely realize the concept of synthetic biology, we decided to have participants manually conducting the experiments. Meanwhile, with our team members' explanation of the experimental principle and the importance of laboratory safety, we can provide participants with clear and comprehensive information on the technology we use.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Although we are well prepared with the course materials and experiment equipment that will be used in the course, it is uncertain for us to make sure whether the explanation and the teaching styles are suitable for people who have never met synthetic biology.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;As a result, we set rehearsals twice and invited peers on our campus with different majors to experience the course and make sure they could completely absorb the knowledge. In return, the peers gave us some advice to improve our teaching styles. To illustrate, the peers point out that some of the principles and technical terms are too abstruse to comprehend, they suggest that we use similes when expounding them. All this advice has ideally helped us complete an excellent activity.

                &emsp;&emsp;In the experiment, to allow the operator to observe the results more effectively and understand the effect of the technology we adopt, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is often used as a reporter gene in synthetic biology as the target gene and has been significantly used in the research field. Also, we use pET15b as plasmid and transform into E. coli. During the experiment, we lead them to start with gene selection, PCR, gel electrophoresis, purification, ligation, and transformation sequentially. Finally, observing the E. coli that expresses GFP protein.

            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;After the camp, we set up a quiz section through Kahoot, which is a platform that provides an interactive game to evaluate whether the participants have indeed obtained the knowledge. The data of results show that over 70% of them have well comprehended the principle we want to convey. Additionally, some participants also sent us a message after the activity, indicating that this activity efficiently piques their interest in synthetic biology, and also sets their misunderstanding with gene transfer straight.

                &emsp;&emsp;According to the data from the Taiwanese government, the elderly percentage near our area is relatively higher than in other places in Taiwan, and through cross-comparison, cardiovascular disease causes great harm here. Hence, based on the research (Oxid Med Cell Longev, Apr 9, 2019, 3756750), we discover that aerobic exercise significantly affects lipid metabolism. Furthermore, we found that "walking" is the easiest way to achieve it in everyone’s daily life because we don’t have to use certain equipment and we can do it without time restrictions. As a result, we initiated a campus walk called ”Walking with the elderly, walking to a better heart.
            </p>
            <h1>Before the activity</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Consequently, we cooperated with the “Center for Innovative Research on Aging Society (CIRAS)” in CCU, they provided us some advice and shared some experience on interacting with the elderly, for example, in the interacting game design, we amended some of the word usages that might mislead the public on CIRAS suggestion. In addition, we went to the village and the elderly university in CCU to invite them to our activity in person, hoping our sincere invitation can interest them to participate in the event. In the promotion phase, we know that some of the elderly seldom have an outdoor activity, therefore, this reinforces us to provide a great opportunity for them to walk with us. 
            </p>
            <h1>Record during the activity</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;On that day, almost a hundred people joined us in the event: “Walking with the elderly, walking to a better heart.” Through this event, we hope to raise public awareness through the interactive game, guiding them to know more about cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we divided the game into 5 stages throughout our walking route.  First, let the public know about the severity of cardiovascular disease. Second, knowing what type of living habit will lead to cardiovascular diseases? Third, how do we prevent cardiovascular disease in every day’s food consumption? Fourth, how do we prevent cardiovascular disease through different kinds of exercise? Last but not least, tested them if they got the ideas for the whole activity.
            </p>
            <h1>Feedback from participants</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;After the event, we received real-life experience in fighting cardiovascular disease from a participant, providing us with a stronger impetus on promoting this issue. A man around 55 years old told us that he suffered from cardiovascular disease 10 years ago, but since he started to do aerobic exercise regularly, the condition has become better and better, and currently, he is no longer having cardiovascular disease. Although the research tells us that aerobic exercise is helpful for cardiovascular disease, it is really touching to hear the real experience through this event. We hope that through our efforts, more people in the world can understand this issue and try to change their lifestyles.
