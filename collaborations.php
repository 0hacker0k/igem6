            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>The process of our collaboration with various iGEM teams is a combination of communicating, learning, improving, and most important of all, a fruitful journey that brings the whole iGEM community closer together. We get to gain advice from others and participate in their projects, which is a mutualism for all of us. Now, scroll down and step on our wonderful journey of collaboration with us!</p>

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During our IHP interview with the dietitian Miranda Chen ( link of dietitian’s IHP page ), she told us that EPA supplement alone wasn’t sufficient enough to prevent CVD. From her professional perspective, she suggested that we should also value the importance of having a healthy diet during daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To promote healthy diets to every citizen on this beautiful planet, we initiated a CVD-Free Cookbook, inviting iGEM teams from all around the world to share special ingredients in their countries that are good for cardiovascular health. Therefore, our cookbook features cuisines that are exotic but also healthy so that people who intend to care for their vessels can check it out for ideas of daily diets.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During our online meetup with Exeter iGEM team, they gave us inspiration on how we could improve our presentation, and we helped each other in finding both of our shortcomings. They are working on the topic of synthetic silk-graphene composites, which is the potential candidate to reduce concerns over silk farming and plastic waste.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Although our projects didn’t share similar approaches or goals, that gave us the opportunities to cut in a completely different and novel perspective on listening to others’ presentations.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the meeting, not only did we get feedback and some questions to clarify deeper, we also learned from their presentation skill, and changed our original lengthy and tedious slides into a more simplified and concise version.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our virtual meeting with iGEM Korea_HS exchanged both of our projects’ ideas. We gave comments on each other’s presentations and asked questions about both of our improvements. After the meeting, they asked us to participate in several of their projects and conferences they held (link of Korea_HS’s badge project), and we surely gained a lot of new abilities and knowledge due to these collaboration opportunities.

                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Our project and team Copenhagen’s share the same goal of protecting marine resources but in different approaches. They focused on making fishing nets, which take a great account of marine garbage nowaday, biodegradable; Whileist, our team tackled the problem of marine resources diminishing by producing EPA supplements that are commonly taken from fish and fish oil by synthetic biology. During our meeting, both of our teams shared our presentations and how we tackle the care of marine resources. Not only did we exchange opinions on both our projects, but they also gave us advice on our CVD-free cookbook to focus on Mediterranean diets due to their profession in food science, which we deeply appreciated.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On 8/17, we joined Taiwan iGEM meet ‘22 to exchange our ideas with other Taiwan iGEM teams. This meet-up was hosted by NCKU_Tainan iGEM team, and the participants include NCHU_Taichung, iGEM NTHU, NYCU_Formosa, iGEM KCIS Xiugang, iGEM CSMU, iGEM Mingdao, GEMS Taiwan, NYCU_Taipei, and our team. During the conference, all participants gathered together to discuss each team’s projects and gave concrete feedback in the hope of improving, including presentation and inspecting and learning each other’s poster.

            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;After the conference, we were inspired to further examine our Quantitative Agar Faucet (link of DL’s quantitative agar faucet). As a result, we reached out to Prof. Lee (link of professor Lee’s IHP page) to explore potential development opportunities.
