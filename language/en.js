In addition, with the improvement of food preservation technology in the kingdom, the number of processed foods has also increased rapidly. Today, high blood pressure, high blood lipids, and high blood sugar are hidden in the kingdom. Three high risks, but the people are unaware of the threat.",
    "back_3":"One day, due to unhealthy eating habits for a long time, the related medical records of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) appeared one after another in the kingdom. In the panic, scholars also eagerly looked for an antidote but found nothing. CVD was titled an incurable disease and began to ravage the kingdom of PACOmega.",
    "back_4":"The grandfather of PACO also suffers from CVD. To heal her grandfather,  she decides to set off to find the antidote for CVD.",

    "vo_7":"Ah! I'm sorry, I haven't introduced myself yet! I'm a fairy from a faraway island. My full name is Escherichia coli, you can call me E. fairy, I'm on the order of your parents to deliver to you to save the kingdom duty.",
    "pa_8":"The kingdom? I don't understand, now that my grandfather is dying, there is no time to pay attention to you to save the kingdom. Also, how do you know my parents, my parents disappeared ten years ago.",
    "vo_9":"Let me tell you the story, let's start with the crisis of the kingdom. Your grandfather and the kingdom are facing the same problems today. Because of the long-term unhealthy eating habits of the people of the kingdom, cardiovascular disease, also known as CVD, is becoming more and more serious.",
    "pa_10":"Cardiovascular disease? CVD?",
    "vo_11":"Cardiovascular disease, that is, diseases related to the heart and blood vessels. The common cause is the blockage of blood vessels caused by atherosclerosis, which leads to poor blood flow and causes various diseases, such as palpitations, dyspnea, and dizziness…",
    "pa_12":"I remember, these seem to be in the books my parents left.",
    "vo_13":"As expected of you, that is to say, the diseases that endangered your grandfather and the country are mainly due to unhealthy eating habits, and the current disaster will only be faced due to the high cholesterol, high fat, high salt, and high sugar diet.",
    "vo_14":"Anyway, I need your help to synthesize the antidote for CVD and save the kingdom together.",
    "pa_15":"And one last question, why do you know my parents?",
    "vo_16":"You still care about this matter... They started to study CVD as early as ten years ago, and after obtaining the qualification for the trial, they went to the island to find the antidote, but they still lost the trial and could not bring the antidote with them back to the kingdom. Before they died, they entrusted everything to me and asked me to entrust the task to you. Now, it's up to you what your reply is.",
    "pa_17":"There is no righteous way to save the people in my heart, I just want to save my grandfather, but I will do my best to complete my mission, and I will do my best to save every life. Therefore, I am willing to take on this task.",

    "vo_21":"Yo! You're awake. What you saw last night was the illusion of me, and the real one will present in this form. Don't look at me like this, I'm like a key on the way to the antidote, and you will need my help to open the road ahead. So, are you ready to go?",
    "pa_22":"The goal is the antidote on the faraway Island. Let's go.",

    "vo_3":"Spiral, the concept has existed for a long time. There are a lot of situations around us. For example, typhoons, swirls, and tornadoes in natural situations. a biological expression like the shell of a snail, and cochlea in humans. even though the universe has spiral traces.",

And then, do you feel the power of the spiral?",

    "npc_11":"Nowadays, the PACOmega kingdom is cursed. According to the oracle, the god of the island is willing to give the blessing if you are the adventurer who is picked by the fairy.",
    "pa_12":"Do you mean that the blessing of the island god might be the antidote?",
    "npc_13":"That's right! but, it also tests whether you can pass the test of god, and get recognized by god.",
    "pa_14":"The test?",
    "vo_15":"There are five priests on this altar, everyone is responsible for one test, and only the adventurer who passes all the tests qualifies to take the antidote.",

I am a researcher, doing all kinds of research, and my boss asked me to do tasks that are not my business and make me not have any time to sleep and dine. Therefore, they lead to an irregular routine. someday, I went to have a body examination, and I was diagnosed that I got the CVDs. to continue my life of research, I decided to find the antidote to cure me",

    "npc_3":"At the same, I dreamed of a thing called itself fairy, and it brought me to find the antidote. After passing tests, I found that it led me to find the god, and passing the forward test just to prove my determination of finding the antidote. But, did the god exist? The god which people dream of is just a spiritual comfort, and it doesn't determine your future, only you can define your future. And then, I gave up asking god for the antidote instead I decided to focus on the method of curing CVDs, but it was too late…",
