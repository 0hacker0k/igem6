In addition, with the improvement of food preservation technology in the kingdom, the number of processed foods has also increased rapidly. Today, high blood pressure, high blood lipids, and high blood sugar are hidden in the kingdom. Three high risks, but the people are unaware of the threat.",
    "back_3":"One day, due to unhealthy eating habits for a long time, the related medical records of cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) appeared one after another in the kingdom. In the panic, scholars also eagerly looked for an antidote but found nothing. CVD was titled an incurable disease and began to ravage the kingdom of PACOmega.",

They started to study CVD as early as ten years ago, and after obtaining the qualification for the stage, they went to the island to find the antidote, but they still lost the stage and could not bring the antidote with them back to the kingdom. Before they died, they entrusted everything to me and asked me to entrust the task to you. Now, it's up to you what your reply is.",

    "pa_3":"Cool! How does that work?",
