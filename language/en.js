    "vo_8":"1. Preparing gel, picking up the conical flask, adding TAE buffer and agarose, heating in the microwave, and pouring in the mold to cool.",
    "vo_9":"2. Loading, picking up the pipette, taking and injecting the marker and the template into the well of the gel one by one.",
    "vo_10":"3. Running gel, immersing the gel in the electrophoresis tank with TAE buffer, powering on, and waiting for a period of time.",
    "vo_11":"4. Gel imaging, irradiating the gel with UV light, taking the photo, and observing the result.",
