            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>
                Whereas stroke or other cerebrovascular diseases will take place if it happens in our cerebrums. No matter what type of CVD it is, we should never underestimate the catastrophe it brings.
            </p>
            <p>
                As it’s quoted “An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure.” Our goal is to raise public awareness of CVD prevention to this life-taking disease. However, current approaches to CVD may not necessarily meet the needs. It has been proven that high level intake of Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) can significantly lower the risk of cardiac events. Fish oil, which is the major source of EPA, might contain heavy metals and microplastics that could cause further damage. Moreover, the consumption of marine resources and vegan-unfriendliness have shown the drawback of using fish oil as EPA source. Algal oil seems to eliminate those concerns fish oil arises. Nevertheless, only taking a high amount of EPA can make effects on CVD prevention, algal oil, which provides mostly DHA supplement, fails to be an efficient method.
            </p>
            <p>
                An intriguing and exciting idea pops out instantly: what if we can make a pure EPA supplement for artery care by using synthetic biology?
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, to be the savior in this CVD era, our team wishes to utilize the power of synthetic biology to create a pure EPA supplement that can both address CVD issues properly and avoid consuming any further contaminated products. At the same time, providing new options for  the vegetarian communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                While our lab work was in full swing, we were challenged simultaneously by many that have dedicated themselves to preventing CVD issues for years. It’s unfolded that our initial "big picture” is too naive to put it into reality. Being a scientist, it’s our least responsible action to ignore what society truly wants.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the intention of providing a harmless and comprehensive solution to CVD issues, we reach out to several experts actively seeking professional advice. We find ourselves in the process of refining our project during the interview with those experts and stakeholders. With the engagement with society, our ideas have gradually become more realistic and feasible. In each phase of our IHP work, we start off by pondering the problem we are to engage, and then we interview the corresponding experts and stakeholders. Revising the deficiencies in accordance with those suggestions to close the loop. As our project progresses, the problem-solving chain has transformed from the retrospection of current situations to society acceptance and finally, adding up new advocations.

            <h1>Interview With The Doctor</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;According to world health organization statistics, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally. It’s estimated that 17.9 million people died from CVDs in 2019, almost 1/3 of the deaths worldwide. In Taiwan, CVD has been rated as the top-three domestic death cause for nearly thirty years.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;We consulted with an anonymous doctor to clarify the rationale behind this issue and discuss the possible solution we could make. He first educated us that, although CVD is undoubtedly serious, it is mostly triggered by aging, which is the most accountable risk factor of CVD. Because of advanced medical technology, the longer people live, the higher the chance of getting CVD is. Second, he acknowledged our idea of making high concentration EPA supplements in prevention of CVD. However, he pointed out the highly competitive nutritional supplement market we are facing. If we could reduce the cost of our production, it could largely enhance our competitiveness.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;After receiving feedback from the doctor, we plan to integrate more into Minxiong, the most aged county in Taiwan in which our campus is located. And grub more details on optimization of our production.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Applying the doctor’s advice, we went on and reached out to the local pharmacist, Wu Chih Kai, and the CEO of TWBIO, Lance Chang.
            </p>
            <h1>Interview With The Pharmacist: Mr. Wu Chih Kai</h1>
            <div class="full_block">
                <div class="img" style="--width:20%;">
                    <img src="<?php echo imgfile;?>/ihp/ihp01.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Mr. Wu Chih Kai is a local pharmacist who has been working in a local drugstore for years. Not only does he possess proficiency in pharmaceutics, but also is familiar with the local market situation.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;During the interview with Mr. Wu, he first reminded us to notice the drug interaction between EPA and other medications. For example, people taking anticoagulants cannot ingest EPA during the whole treatment due to the concern of synergism, causing the risk of massive hemorrhage.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;When it comes to self evaluation, Taiwanese people tend to overlook their health conditions if they aren’t undergoing routine health check periods every season. With the help of Mr. Wu’s professional idea, he suggested that our product should be designed as a monthly-taking form so that people can be more aware of the improvement of their health. This useful suggestion provokes us to ponder our product price when marketing.
            </p>
            <h1>Interview With Yan-Chang Lee PH.D.</h1>
            <div class="full_block">
                <div class="img" style="--width:20%;">
                    <img src="<?php echo imgfile;?>/ihp/ihp02.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Yan-Chang Lee is currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Research Center for Precision Molding, National Chung Cheng University.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;After running through countless times of time-consuming experimental procedures, we couldn’t help but ask ourselves: Were those all that necessary? Could we save our energy from trivial steps and invest it on something more important? Thus, to reduce unnecessary waste of manpower, we have decided to optimize our experiment by designing an automatic gel preparation machine and quantitative agar faucet to be more efficient and accurate. We want to engage with those who have rich experience in experimentation to reinforce our idea. This led us to the interview with Dr. Lee.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Throughout the meeting, Dr. Lee patiently stressed the importance of knowing the user’s needs. He was interested in our design, pointing out that the potential clients of our quantitative agar faucet might probably be institutions with limited learning resources. Being unaffordable to those fancy but costly utensils like electronic pipette, our quantitative agar faucet can perfectly meet their needs, while electronic pipettes are too good to have.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Upholding our idea with the automatic gel preparation machine, Dr. Lee has observed the trend of introducing automatic machines into the experimentation. He then gave us many insights of enhancements on it, including the idea of microchannel applied to the heating device, the concept of injection molding, and other recommended quantitative devices for better preparation of solution. With these suggestions, the process of making agarose gel by our machine will be conducted more smoothly and efficiently.

                <h1 class="title_label" style="background-image:url('<?php echo imgfile;?>/tape.png')">Introducing Synthetic Biology to the Public</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;While it might seem like a brilliant idea to bring synthetic biology directly to the market, we are hampered, seriously but not surprisingly, by the result of our market survey. It turned out that about 60% of the respondents didn’t accept it, let alone something whose production involves the notorious <i>E. coli</i>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;From this, it’s clear that society's attitude toward synthetic biology remains negative. Hence, if we are to be responsible and reliable scientists, we should never blank the opposite voices out. We want to know what really repels people from <i>E. coli</i>. Therefore, we turned to Dr. Chang-Jer Wu for help. 
            </p>
            <h1>Interview with Chang-Jer Wu PH.D.</h1>
            <div class="full_block">
                <div class="img" style="--width:20%;">
                    <img src="<?php echo imgfile;?>/ihp/ihp03.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Chang-Jer Wu is currently a distinguished professor and the chairman in the Department of Food Science, National Taiwan Ocean University. He is also the secretary general of the Health Food Society of Taiwan. His speciality includes molecular biology, virology and immunology.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;First and foremost, Dr. Wu told us that it’s Endotoxin that gets in our way. Endotoxin is a kind of lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ), composing the outer cell wall of all gram-negative bacteria, and is responsible for the organization and stability of the outer membrane. Ingesting Endotoxin in human bodies will cause the symptoms of high fever, vasodilation, diarrhea, and in extreme cases, fatal shock. However, while Endotoxin poses a great deal of threats to us, it would be our turnaround if we can overcome this problem. Because if we make pure and high concentration EPA production into reality, we can shift our product from nutritional supplement-oriented to treatment-oriented, which the latter generates much more profits than the former.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Wu also reminded us of the regulation we would face in the future when selling. To protect consumers’ health, there are many constrictions we have to follow to fulfill the goal. While this warning isn't contained in our current projects, we should always make hay while the sun shines.
            </p>
            <div id="3" class="title-label-div">
                <h1 class="title_label" style="background-image:url('<?php echo imgfile;?>/tape.png')">Bridging the Gap</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Distrust derives from unfamiliarity, if we are to apply synthetic biology to society, we must first let people realize what this technical term refers to. Therefore, we held an Open Lab science camp, inviting high school students in Taiwan to get involved in synthetic biological experiments. To let the participants know the procedures of experimentation better, we made sure that each person operated the experimentation under the instructions of teaching assistants, and conformed to the bio-safety rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;We used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as our material to demonstrate how synthetic biological experiments are being conducted in college labs. During the activity, we started with gene selection, PCR, gel electrophoresis, purification, ligation, and transformation respectively. Finally, presenting the results of a successful expression of GFP protein in <i>E. coli</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;The feedback showed that over 70% of the students have a good understanding in the field of synthetic biology, both in the background knowledge and experimental operation. With this experience, we realized the importance of science communication that should not only be done in the academic seminars, but also in a much more practical and integrated way.
            </p>
            <div id="4" class="title-label-div">
                <h1 class="title_label" style="background-image:url('<?php echo imgfile;?>/tape.png')">Reconsider Our Idea: Is It Enough?</h1>
            </div>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;At this phase, we have put a lot of effort into refining our EPA supplements according to suggestions we’ve received with regard to marketing and production. As everything was on the track, we found ourselves in the midst of narrowing down our perspectives of what it took to be healthy. Because what we had done so far was merely focusing on EPA production, there was no doubt that we were on the right path to CVD prevention. The problem was: Is there anything else we should put into consideration?
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;We started to wonder: If nutritional supplements alone can effectively prevent CVD, then why do some people still suffer even though taking great amounts of nutritional supplements? Obviously, it goes without saying that nutritional supplements aren’t sufficient to prevent CVD. There was something we had overlooked and failed to tell the whole story of CVD prevention, that is, a balanced, healthy lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;To compensate for the missing part, we consulted with a sports science expert and a dietitian to discuss the idea of forming a healthy lifestyle.
            </p>
            <h1>Interview With Dietitian, Miranda Chen</h1>
            <div class="full_block">
                <div class="img" style="--width:20%;">
                    <img src="<?php echo imgfile;?>/ihp/ihp04.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;As mentioned in our overview, we took the prevention and precaution of CVD in our priority. In our IHP meeting with the dietitian, while we inquired about how to put the prospect in action, the dietitian gave us the theses to prevent CVD effectively. She told us that prevention of CVDs should initiate from the optimization of daily routines, which can be specifically themed on the emphasizing of daily exercises and diets, in such cultivation of healthy daily habits can the public achieve artery caring.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Following dietitian Miranda’s suggestion, our team came up with two ways to promote the two concepts of healthy diet and daily exercise: We made a CVD-free cookbook that contains various dishes which benefits on CVD preventions (link to collab CVD cookbook) so that people who wants to “eat healthy” can have a path to move on. Whereas, we initiated a campus walking activity (link to campus walking) which hundreds of citizens around our campus have attended, and set up stands to publicize the importance of daily exercises.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;After the interview with the dietitian, our path toward national healthcare has found its concrete road to take: to do the publicity of healthy diet and daily exercises. This goal guides us to the issue that, what kind of exercise is effective for CVD prevention? Thus, it fuels the flames for us to find our next professional consultation, with professor Shuk-Fong Lee, who is the professor and chair of the department of athletic sports in Chung Cheng University.
            </p>
            <h1>Interview With Shuk-Fong Lee PH.D.</h1>
            <div class="full_block">
                <div class="img" style="--width:20%;">
                    <img src="<?php echo imgfile;?>/ihp/ihp05.jpg">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Shuk-Fong Lee is the chair of the department of athletic sports of our own campus, Chung Cheng University. She is an expert not only in exercise psychology, but also has done several researches on exercise prescription for elderlies specifically. Dr. Lee’s expertise happens to coincide with our needs. Therefore, we consulted her with some questions about how CVD patients or potential patients should do exercise and how we could promote daily exercise to the public.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Dr. Lee suggested that High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) has direct proportion with High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which is strenuous exercises that last for 30 seconds, stop for 30 seconds, and keep on the whole process for 3 minutes. In addition, she told us that the campus walking we held is effective but not efficient. It can achieve the publicity of the importance of daily exercises, but isn’t the best choice to maintain health care and CVD prevention. Instead, doing weight training, squat, and interval training with professional coaches will have a more significant effect.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;As a result, this interview gave us a whole new perspective on doing exercises. “When you see a person with great skin and fair body, you're only going to ask if that person used any body care products or ate any nutritional supplements. Seldom will ask, what kind of exercise have you done?” said professor Lee. While we seek for outer care to improve bodily health, it is crucial for us not to leave every muscle, every piece of bone, every inch of skin behind. Professor Lee not only brought us new knowledge of daily exercise, but also roused our consciousness of health care, not by any supplements, but only by our own selves.

            </div>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;Interaction with the stakeholders and those who are impacted helped us identify two main values that should be considered: (1) comprehensive perspectives on CVD prevention and (2) Engaging with those impacted.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;During our IHP journey, it’s crucial that we follow these two values to keep aligned with the society and bridge the connection:
            </p>
            <h1>1. Comprehensive perspective on CVD Prevention</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;While it’s our initial idea to prevent CVD by producing EPA inside our lab, it requires more than just ingesting good oil, but also staying away from bad oil as well. However, to meet up with the goal of having a balanced lifestyle, we should also value the importance of regular exercising in effort to increase the beneficial HDL.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;With these three approaches, people who want to improve their arterial health would have a better understanding to follow.
            </p>
            <h1>2. Engaged with those affected</h1>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;The relative component of our ultimate goal, advocating CVD prevention, is to introduce synthetic biological production EPA to the society. Therefore, we should always stay in tune with public acceptance and discussion.
            </p>
            <p class="h25">
                &emsp;&emsp;Keeping up with both negative and positive opinions, that should never be regarded as a transitional goal, but rather, an human practice work that should be thoroughly implemented throughout all phases. Most importantly, always reminding ourselves of the importance of bringing the sharing opportunity between both scientific and general communities.
