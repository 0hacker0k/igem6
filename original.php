                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;During our IHP interview with the dietitian Miranda Chen ( link of dietitian’s IHP page ), she told us that EPA supplement alone wasn’t sufficient enough to prevent CVD. From her professional perspective, she suggested that we should also value the importance of having a healthy diet during daily life.
            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;To promote healthy diets to every citizen on this beautiful planet, we initiated a CVD-Free Cookbook, inviting iGEM teams from all around the world to share special ingredients in their countries that are good for cardiovascular health. Therefore, our cookbook features cuisines that are exotic but also healthy so that people who intend to care for their vessels can check it out for ideas of daily diets.
